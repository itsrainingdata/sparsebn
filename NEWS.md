# sparsebn 0.0.3

## Features

## Notes

## Bug fixes

# sparsebn 0.0.2

## Features
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package
* Added plotDAG to provide convenient default for plotting large graphs
* `estimate.dag` now takes an optional logical argument `adaptive`: If `TRUE`, then an adaptive version of the CD algorithm will be run for discrete data. This argument is ignored for continuous data.
* Vignette updated and re-written

## Bug fixes

* Cytometry data has been fixed to correct some errors in the network structure; now correctly reflects the network learned in Sachs et al. (2005)

# sparsebn 0.0.1
